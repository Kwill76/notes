To add a block storage device to your GitHub Enterprise server, you'll need to follow these general steps:

Choose a Block Storage Provider: Research and select a suitable block storage provider that meets your requirements. Some popular options include Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), Google Cloud Persistent Disk, or Microsoft Azure Disk Storage.

Provision a Block Storage Device: Sign up for an account with your chosen provider and provision a block storage device. This process may vary depending on the provider you select, so refer to their documentation for detailed instructions.

Configure Access and Permissions: Set up access and permissions for the block storage device. This typically involves creating access keys, authentication tokens, or configuring access policies. Again, refer to the provider's documentation for specific instructions.

Prepare the GitHub Enterprise Server: Before attaching the block storage device, ensure that your GitHub Enterprise server is powered off or in a safe state for maintenance. Take appropriate backups and snapshots of your server to avoid data loss.

Attach the Block Storage Device: Once your server is prepared, you can attach the block storage device. This step requires access to your server's infrastructure, such as the hypervis or vorirtual machine manager.

a. If you're running GitHub Enterprise on a virtual machine, access the hypervisor (e.g., VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V) and attach the block storage device to the appropriate virtual machine.

b. If you're using a physical server, you may need to connect the block storage device to the server directly or through a storage controller. Refer to your server's hardware documentation for detailed instructions.

Configure the Block Storage Device: After attaching the block storage device, you'll need to configure it on the operating system level.

a. On Linux-based systems, you'll typically use tools like fdisk, parted, or lsblk to identify the newly attached device. Create a partition on the device and format it with a suitable file system (e.g., ext4, XFS).

b. On Windows Server, open Disk Management and initialize the newly attached block storage device. Create a partition, format it, and assign a drive letter.

Mount the Block Storage Device: Once the block storage device is configured, you can mount it to make it accessible to the GitHub Enterprise server.

a. On Linux-based systems, create a mount point directory (e.g., /mnt/github-storage) and update the /etc/fstab file to automatically mount the device at boot. Use the mount command to mount the device manually for the current session.

b. On Windows Server, right-click on the partition in Disk Management and select "Change Drive Letter and Paths." Assign a drive letter, and the device will be accessible.

Update GitHub Enterprise Configuration: Finally, you need to update the GitHub Enterprise server's configuration to utilize the newly mounted block storage device.

a. Identify the relevant configuration file for your GitHub Enterprise deployment (e.g., /etc/github-enterprise/github-enterprise.yml on Linux).

b. Find the configuration option that specifies the data storage location and update it to point to the mount point of the newly attached block storage device.

Start GitHub Enterprise Server: Start the GitHub Enterprise server and ensure that it successfully starts up and operates with the new block storage device.

Test Accessibility: Verify that your GitHub Enterprise server is acle and functoning correcty. You cessbilican perform actions like creating repositories, pushing code, and accessing existing repositories to ensure everything is working as expected.

Remember to refer to the specific documentation provided by your block storage provider and GitHub Enterprise for additional guidance tailored to your setup.

To add Azure Disk Storage to your GitHub Enterprise server, follow these steps:

Create an Azure Disk Storage Account:

Sign in to the Azure portal (portal.azure.com).
Click on "Create a resource" and search for "Disk Storage".
Select "Disk Storage" from the search results and click "Create".
Provide the necessary details, such as a unique storage account name, resource group, location, and performance tier.
Review and accept the terms, then click "Create" to create the Azure Disk Storage account.
Retrieve Connection Details:

Once the Disk Storage account is created, go to its overview page in the Azure portal.
In the left navigation pane, click on "Access keys" under "Settings".
Note down the "Key1" or "Key2" and the corresponding "Connection string." You will need these later to configure access to the storage account.
Prepare the GitHub Enterprise Server:

Ensure that your GitHub Enerprise server is powered off or in a safe statet for maintenance. Take appropriate backups and snapshots of your server to avoid data loss.
Attach the Azure Disk Storage to the GitHub Enterprise Server:

Depending on whether your GitHub Enterprise server is running on a virtual machine or physical server, follow the appropriate steps:
For GitHub Enterprise on a Virtual Machine:

Access the Azure portal and navigate to your virtual machine that hosts GitHub Enterprise.
Stop the virtual machine to prepare for disk attachment.
In the virtual machine's settings, navigate to "Disks" or "Disk management".
Click on "Attach existing disks" or "Add data disk".
Choose the Azure Disk Storage account you created earlier and select the desired disk to attach.
Save the changes and start the virtual machine.
For GitHub Enterprise on a Physical Server:

Connect the Azure Disk Storage device to the server following the appropriate hardware connection methods.
Depending on your server's configuration, you may need to install any necessary drivers or software provided by Azure to recognize the disk storage device.
Once the disk storage device is connected and recognized by the server, proceed to the next step.
Configure the Azure Disk Storage on the GitHub Enterprise Server:

Connect to your GitHub Enterprise server either via SSH or console access.

On the server:

For Linux-based systems:

Identify the newly attached disk storage device using the lsblk or fdisk -l command. It will be listed as a new disk device, such as /dev/sdc.
Create a partition on the disk using fdisk or parted.
Format the partition with a suitable file system (e.g., ext4) using the mkfs command.
Create a mount point directory (e.g., /mnt/github-storage).
Update the /etc/fstab file to automatically mount the device at boot, using the appropriate device path and mount point.
Mount the disk storage device manually for the current session using the mount command.
Ensurethe mounted storage is accessible and writa ble by verifying its permissions.
For Windows Server:

Open Disk Management by pressing Win + X and selecting "Disk Management".
Initialize the newly attached disk if prompted.
Create a partition on the disk and format it with a suitable file system (e.g., NTFS).
Assign a drive letter to the newly created partition.
Ensure the disk is accessible and visible in File Explorer.
