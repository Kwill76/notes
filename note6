Attach the Block Storage Device: Once your server is prepared, you can attach the block storage device. This step requires access to your server's infrastructure, such as the hypervis or vorirtual machine manager.

a. If you're running GitHub Enterprise on a virtual machine, access the hypervisor (e.g., VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V) and attach the block storage device to the appropriate virtual machine.

b. If you're using a physical server, you may need to connect the block storage device to the server directly or through a storage controller. Refer to your server's hardware documentation for detailed instructions.

Configure the Block Storage Device: After attaching the block storage device, you'll need to configure it on the operating system level.

a. On Linux-based systems, you'll typically use tools like fdisk, parted, or lsblk to identify the newly attached device. Create a partition on the device and format it with a suitable file system (e.g., ext4, XFS).

b. On Windows Server, open Disk Management and initialize the newly attached block storage device. Create a partition, format it, and assign a drive letter.

Mount the Block Storage Device: Once the block storage device is configured, you can mount it to make it accessible to the GitHub Enterprise server.

a. On Linux-based systems, create a mount point directory (e.g., /mnt/github-storage) and update the /etc/fstab file to automatically mount the device at boot. Use the mount command to mount the device manually for the current session.

b. On Windows Server, right-click on the partition in Disk Management and select "Change Drive Letter and Paths." Assign a drive letter, and the device will be accessible.

Update GitHub Enterprise Configuration: Finally, you need to update the GitHub Enterprise server's configuration to utilize the newly mounted block storage device.

a. Identify the relevant configuration file for your GitHub Enterprise deployment (e.g., /etc/github-enterprise/github-enterprise.yml on Linux).

b. Find the configuration option that specifies the data storage location and update it to point to the mount point of the newly attached block storage device.

Start GitHub Enterprise Server: Start the GitHub Enterprise server and ensure that it successfully starts up and operates with the new block storage device.

Test Accessibility: Verify that your GitHub Enterprise server is acle and functoning correcty. You cessbilican perform actions like creating repositories, pushing code, and accessing existing repositories to ensure everything is working as expected.

Remember to refer to the specific documentation provided by your block storage provider and GitHub Enterprise for additional guidance tailored to your setup.
