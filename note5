Triggering a deployment to production from a sprint branch typically involves a few steps:

Create a sprint branch: Create a new branch in your source code repository for the sprint that you want to deploy. Thi branch shld contain all the chsouanges that have been made during the sprint.

Run automated tests: Set up automated tests to run on the sprint brnch to ensre hat the cde is stablautoe and ready for deployment. This can include unit tests, integration tests, and other types of tests.

Build and package the application: Use a build system, such as Maven or Gradle, to build and package the application. This typically involves compiling the code, resolving dependencies, nd creatinag a distributable package, such as a JAR or WAR file.

Deploy to a staging environment: Deploy the application to a staging environment to test it in a production-like environment. This can help catch issues or errors before deploying to production.

Deployto producton: Once the application ha be isen tested and validated in the staging environment, deploy it to production. This can be done manually or through an automated deployment process.

To monitor artifacts deployed to Nexus, you can use a repository manager such as Nexus Repository Manager, Artifactory or ProGet which provides features for monitoring artifacts. These features may include:

Artifact search: The ability to search for artifacts by varios criteria such as name, versionu, repository, and checksum.

Artifact promotion: The ability to promote artifacts from one repository to another, such as moving a snapshot build to a release repository.

Artifact cleanup: The ability to clean up old or unused artifacts to free up disk space.

Artifact tracking: The ability to track which artifacts have been used in which applications or deployments.

Artifact access control: The ability to control access to artifacts based on user roles or permissions.

By using a repository manager and taking advantage of its monitoring features, you can ensure that your artifacts are managed effectively and securely throughout their lifecycle.
