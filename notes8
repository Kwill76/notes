ChatGPT
To add Blob storage to your GitHub Enterprise Server hosted on the Azure platform, you can follow these steps:

Create a Storage Account: In the Azure portal (portal.azure.com), navigate to the Azure Storage section and create a new storage account. Provide the necessary details, such as storage account name, deployment model (standard or premium), replication type, and other configuration options. Choose the appropriate settings based on your requirements.

Configure Blob Storage: Once the storage account is created, navigate to the storage account's overview page. From there, locate the "Blob service" section or the "Containers" tab. Create a new container within the storage account to store your GitHub Enterprise Server data. Specify the container name and set the appropriate access level (e.g., private, public read access, or custom access policy).

Retrieve Connection String: To connect GitHub Enterprise Server to the Blob storage, you need to obtain the connection string for the storage account. In the Azure portal, navigate to the storage account's overview page. Look for the "Access keys" or "Settings" section and click on it. Retrieve the connection string from the available options. You will need this connection string in the next steps.

Access GitHub Enterprise Server Configuration: Access your GitHub Enterprise Server instance, either through the web interface or via remote access (e.g., Remote Desktop), and navigate to the server configuration area.

Configure Blob Storage in GitHub Enterprise Server: In the GitHub Enterprise Server configuration, find the settings related to storage or object storage. Specify the connection details for the Blob storage using the connection string obtained in Step 3. This may involve providing the storage account name, access key, container name, and other relevant information.

Save and Apply Configuration: Save the configuration changes in GitHub Enterprise Server. The server will establish a connection to the Blob storage using the provided details.

By following these steps, you can add Blob storage to your GitHub Enterprise Server hosted on the Azure platform. This allows you to store your GitHub data, including repositories, metadata, and artifacts, in the Blob storage. Make sure to review the documentation and guidelines provided by GitHub for configuring storage options specific to GitHub Enterprise Server.
