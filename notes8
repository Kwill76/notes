The standard requirements for hosting GitHub Enterprise Server on the Azure platform can vary based on factors such as the number of users, repository size, and expected workload. However, here are some general considerations and recommendations:

Virtual Machine Size: Choose an Azure virtual machine (VM) ize that meets the performance and rsesource requirements of your GitHub Enterprise Server deployment. GitHub recommends using at least a Standard_D4s_v3 VM size or higher for small to medium-sized deployments. For larger deployments, you might need larger VM sizes such as Standard_E8s_v3 or higher. It's important to consider the CPU, memory, and disk resources provided by the chosen VM size.

Disk Size: Determine the appropriate disk size based on your expected usage and storage requirements. Consider factors like the size of your repositories, the number of users, and the frequency of code commits. GitHub recommends a minimum of 50 GB of available disk space for a small-scale deployment. However, for larger deployments with a high number of repositories and users, you may need significantly more disk space.

Networking: Ensure that the VM hosting your GitHub Enterprise Server is connected to a virtual network in Azure. Configure the necessary network settings, such as subnets, security groups, and network access controls, to provide the required connectivity and security for your deployment.

Backup and Disaster Recovery: Implement a backup and disaster recovery strategy to protect your GitHub Enterprise Server data. This may involve regularly backing up the server data and configurations, setting up replication or geo-redundancy for your storage, and considering Azure-specific options like Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery.

High Availability and Load Balancing: For improved availability and scalability, you can consider setting up multiple instances of GitHub Enterprise Server in a load-balanced configuration. This can help distribute the workload and provide redundancy in case of failures.

Monitoring and Performance Otimization: Implement monitoiprng and performance optimization practices to ensure the smooth operation of your GitHub Enterprise Server. This may involve configuring monitoring tools, setting up alerts for key metrics, optimizing VM performance settings, and regularly reviewing resource utilization.

It's important to review the specific requirements and recommendations provided by GitHub for hosting GitHub Enterprise Server. These guidelines may vary based on the version of GitHub Enterprise Server you are using. Consult the official GitHub Enterprise Server documentation for detailed information and best practices specific to your deployment.
